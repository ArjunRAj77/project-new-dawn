We propose a solution that aims perfectly on the development of local communities. We've built New dawn by leveraging the power of Azure cloud resources. A "one stop" for all needs essential for day-to-day life, from finding jobs to selling products online and meeting people of same interests across the neighborhood. All the mentioned requirements met in a single web-app which contributes to the well-being and economy of a local community.

New Dawn offers a solution where we can:

-Connect better with each other from within a small neighborhood/community. -Get to know each other better. -Discuss ides and problems together and come up with solutions. -Support independent workers within the community. -Provide exposure and support to local market and home grown business. -Collaborate and bring forward issues together so the local authorities can involve better in solving them. -Platform to show-case the skills.
