A community management solution shaped itself in a web- app . Pandemic has taught us the value of community, what if we can build a better community with the power of technology?
<br>Project New Dawn aims at increasing the quality of life in a community with the help of technology. It gives emphasis on providing a better community experience through a webapp.

New Dawn leverages the features provided by the Azure cloud platform and a bunch of OTHER new available technologies to create a hybrid online community.

<p>
We propose a solution that aims perfectly on the development of local communities. We've built New dawn by leveraging the power of Azure cloud resources. A "one stop" for all needs essential for day-to-day life, from finding jobs to selling products online and meeting people of same interests across the neighborhood. All the mentioned requirements met in a single web-app which contributes to the well-being and economy of a local community.</p>

New Dawn offers a solution where we can:

1. Connect better with each other from within a small neighborhood/community.
2. Get to know each other better. 
3. Discuss ides and problems together and come up with solutions. 
4. Support independent workers within the community. 
5. Provide exposure and support to local market and home grown business. 
6. Collaborate and bring forward issues together so the local authorities can involve better in solving them. 
7. Platform to show-case the skills.
